    <p id ="para3">Food Fighters is a card game created by Richard Austin. It is a game with a bunch of collectable cards all with unique 
    characters. Each card's character is based on a food with their own occupation. There's everything from wizards to pirates in the vast
    collection of cards. Each card has their own individual stats along with a special ability. Using these things calls for a simple, yet
    advanced battle system. You can battle players who also have cards to see who will be victorious. With some practice and a little strategy,
    Food Fighters is a very fun card game to enjoy with your frieds.</p>
