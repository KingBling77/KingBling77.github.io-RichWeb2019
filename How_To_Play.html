    <p id ="blockexplain">Another move you can do in battle is blocking. When someone goes to attack you, you have the option to block.
    To block all you have to do is call a coin right. If you call it right you will only take half the damage of the atk.</p>
    <p id ="dodgeexplain">Dodging is a move you can do if you are being attacked. If someone tries to attack you, you
    can attempt to use dodge. This is how it works. First, the player trying to attack you will roll the 20-sided dice.
    Next, you will roll the dice and try to roll a higher number. If you roll a higher number than the attacker you will
    successfully perform a dodge. If you dodge their attack you will take no damage from the attack. If you roll the same
    number as the attacker you won't dodge and you'll take the hit like normal. If you roll a number lower than the attacker
    you will take more damage. However much the atk is you divide it in half and add that to the original. For exampe, if their
    atk is 10 and you fail the dodge you'll divide the atk in half, which is 5, and add that to the original atk, which is 10.
    10 + 5 = 15 which means the attack will now do that much damage for that turn only. if the attack is an odd number you'll take
    the higher one. For example if the atk is 17, half would be 9 because 9 and 8 are the closest halves. You can also only dodge
    every other turn.</p>

    <p id ="defexplain">The last stat on the back of your card is Defense (or def). Defense is a unique property on
    your card that acts as a sort of sheild. If you are attacked, the damage will go to the def before the hp. Once
    your card's def reaches 0 you won't die but you'll be vulnerable to attacks. Def also allows you to do something
    special in battle. If your card has at least 1 point of def, you're able to block.</p>
    <p id ="hpexplain">The Health Points (or hp) stat on the back of your card is its health. When your card is attacked
    and has no defense, or a special move is applied, your card's hp will go down. You will want to try your best to make
    sure your card has hp. This is because once your card's hp reaches 0, it has died and can no longer be used that round
    (unless it is revived by a different card).</p>
    <p id ="turnexplain">This is how the turn system works in Food Fighters. The match will begin with each
    person rolling the 20-sided dice. The order will be greatest to least. If the same number is rolled between
    two people, they will both reroll. If someone else already rolled a number higher than the two who tied, they're
    still ahead of them. The tie-breaker is only between those two players. Once the order is established the battle
    will begin. The first player will have their turn. They get to select one out of the all the available battlers to
    attack. There can be up to four players in a single battle. Once the player attacks, the player being attacked
    can attempt to dodge or block. We'll explain more on that later.</p>
    <p id ="para2">Food Fighters is a card game that is really quite simple. You, battle up to 3 opponents
    and try to be the last one alive. If you look on the back of a card you will see some information.
    There are your cards stats (Atk, Hp, and Def) along with your card's special. These are the things you 
    look at while you are engaed in a battle.</p>
    <p id ="atkexplain">If you look on the back of one of your Food Fighter cards, you'll see three stats at the top. Attack
    (or atk) is the amount of damage your card does to other cards. For example, if your card's atk is 15 and you attack another
    card, that card would take 15 points of damage. There are also certain power cards that can increase your cards atk for a round.</p>
